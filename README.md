## ASOT, a suite of analysis routines for the ARMS code

> *"Or to take arms against **A** **S**ea **O**f **T**roubles"* 

    -- W. Shakespeare

    .

Most of the routines are written in Python3. **To make them work, you must change the path near the top of each file, which by default is `'/Change/This/Path'`**

`frequently changed variables`

`import sys`

`sys.path[:0]=['/Change/This/Path']`

`from ARMS_ASOT_Functions import *`

`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`

Note that this repository is an effort to share a personal set of routines which have many embarrassingly poor optimizations and the like. Any input is appreciated.
